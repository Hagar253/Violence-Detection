# Violence-Detection

With more access to the internet, children are more likely to be exposed to violent content where harm is being done to a person or character. Studies show that 37% of media aimed at children have scenes of physical or verbal violence. What’s more, 90% of movies, 60% of TV shows, and 15% of music videos have some form of violence. Studies have linked exposure to violence in media, digital media, and entertainment with increased aggression and the perpetration of violence in individuals exposed. Our project aims to create a violence detection system using artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle the urgent problem of children being exposed to violent media. With the help of this technology, parents will have a proactive tool to protect their children from violent content by automatically identifying violent sequences in cartoons, movies, and other media.

## Dataset

The dataset used is called "Real Life Violence Situations Dataset" provided by Kaggle. It has the following citation: M. Soliman, M. Kamal, M. Nashed, Y. Mostafa, B. Chawky, D. Khattab, “ Violence Recognition from Videos using Deep Learning Techniques”, Proc. 9th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Information Systems (ICICIS'19), Cairo, pp. 79-84, 2019.

## Objectives of the project:

1. Develop a CNN+LSTM model that analyzes visual content that is indicative of violent signs in videos. 

2. Use a dataset that has diverse video content containing both violent and non-violent scenes across various genres and contexts. 

3. Train the model using the annotated dataset to learn patterns and features associated with violent scenes and optimize the model until reaching satisfying accuracy results. 

4. Evaluate the trained model using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the algorithm's ability of generalization across new video contents.
